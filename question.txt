Q: How to see indexes for a database or table in MySQL?

How do I see if my database has any indexes on it?

How about for a specific table?

To see the index for a specific table use SHOW INDEX:

```
SHOW INDEX FROM yourtable;
```

To see indexes for all tables within a specific schema you can use the STATISTICS table from INFORMATION_SCHEMA:

```
SELECT DISTINCT
    TABLE_NAME,
    INDEX_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STATISTICS
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'your_schema';
```

Removing the where clause will show you all indexes in all schemas.
